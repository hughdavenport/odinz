This repo is a hobby project implementing a [z-machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine) in the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org/). The language is new to me so I'm using it as a learning project.

The Z-machine is a virtual machine that was developed in 1979 (!!) to play text adventure games. One such example is the [Zork trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork): The Great Underground Empire, The Wizard of Frobozz, and The Dungeon Master. I grew up playing Zork.

Zork was originally developed by [Infocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom) along with many other games. Infocom was acquired by Activision in the mid 80's who then shut down that division in the late 80's. Activision still owns the copyright to the games as far as I know.

I am developing this along side a [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4Gjps5gIjw&list=PL5r5Q39GjMDfyTr-QAT0hU81j5ly1nTpB) where I will build this to play my copy of Zork.

I will be following the [standards document](https://www.inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/current/overview.html), which has helpfully been [annotated to be clearer](https://zspec.jaredreisinger.com/). I will also use the [Infocom Toolkit (Z-tools)](https://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/ztools.html) as reference material, such as Txd the disassembler, and Infodump the story file parser.
